# Password Encryption and Decryption with GUI

A simple Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) for encrypting and decrypting text messages using a password. The application uses the `base64` module for encoding and decoding messages.

## Overview

This Python program provides a user-friendly interface for performing encryption and decryption of text messages. The main features include:

- Encryption: Enter a password and the text message you want to encrypt. The program will encode the message and display the encrypted result.

- Decryption: Enter the same password and the encrypted message to decrypt it. The program will decode the message and display the original text.

- Reset: Clear the input fields with a single click.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (usually included with Python)

## How to Run

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt.

4. Navigate to the directory where the project is located.

5. Run the application by executing the following command:
6. python password_encrypt_decrypt.py
 
7. The GUI will appear, allowing you to encrypt and decrypt messages.

## Usage
